Having been assigned by my team at Mobile2App the privilege of choosing the type of application for our next project development venture, and after some trepidation, I have opted to design and create an inventory management app.  This application is intended for a small business, a collector, or an independent retailer for use in managing their inventory.
Many features need to be included in the end, but before we begin the development process, I will describe and lay out the most core and vital features.
	Once we get more familiar with the basics of Android Studio, we will be able to identify the appropriate corresponding layouts and widgets used to create the following features. In this proposal, I will provide descriptions of these basic features at a higher level of abstraction.
We need to include a database that consists of two tables. The table for login information, and the table to store item inventory. There should also be a separate screen for new users to register or to log in as a given user. The main screen, once logged in, needs to show the main inventory table, the options for adding and removing items, and the option for updating product quantity for each field entry. Additionally, our application needs to include functionality that notifies the user when the stock of one of their items becomes zero.
The user interface will be built with Android Studio. The database can be created with SQLite. With SQLite, we have access to an encryption algorithm for storing hashed passwords, a notification system which we can integrate with Android’s notification manager. Notably, we will not need the database itself in the cloud since this app is going to be deployed at completion for use by one individual user at a time. A local database should be enough to host these single-user transactions. 
Our app is going to be extremely barebones due to the introductory level abilities of the student we have employed (Hunter Marx). That is to be expected and will showcase how beautifully simple the process of building functional applications can be with Android Studio. 
On the current marketplace, there are many existing inventory management apps. Oddo markets themselves as an “all in one” business application interface. Oddo has a website where they host an online browser version of their service. In addition, the software is available for download on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and Android OS. Oddo includes several services for use by business, including inventory management. Oddo has a smooth and sleek design, and while our team is encouraged to draw inspiration from this, they will surely stamp their creative vision for the interface to parallel the simplistic functionality of our inventory management app. 
Box Hero is another inventory management app currently on the market, whose services are more in line with our own as a simple application that solely offers inventory management services. Box Hero should serve as a realistic marker of the types of services our team may wish to emulate. A few features in Box Hero may well still be beyond the scope of our team, such as the ability to scan barcodes.  
Most other options on the market exhibit either high prices, or high learning curves. Our userbase is not being adequately served in their need of a sleek and simple interface and zero cost. There is certainly a place in the application marketplace for us.
Some intended users for this application would be a personal collector, a small business, and an independent retailer. A personal collector could greatly benefit by having a digital mirror of their collection at any given point, especially one that is easy to access on their smartphone and can be diligently modified and updated at their discretion, following trades and purchases.  A small business or personal retailer may want to keep a digital record of their stock to be compared with employee retail records or on hand quantities of their product.  A digital record in the form of our application would be a more streamlined strategy than handwriting each painstaking transaction and modification like many small businesses and independent retailers still do for lack of a better option. Stock can be counted semi-frequently and compared with the digital record. There would be just enough functionality to track significant discrepancies from damaged orders or shoplifting incidents.
I have outlined the intended goals and basic features of our inventory management app to be entered into production immediately. I have highlighted the intended user base for this application and showcased the market need for it in comparison to existing alternatives. The application will be a fitting project for our intern developer, Hunter Marx, and should be a productive project for him to apply his current skillset and add to it the ability to use Android Studio.
