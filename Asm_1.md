Mint (finance managing app)

Mint is a popular finance managing app. This means that it is meant to provide personal guidelines for an individual user, as well as an easily accessible visual interface from which the user may keep track of their budget and spending. 
There are several screens within the app which each provides unique interfaces. The home screen provides a summary of the user's finances such as account balances and net worth. The UI component on the home screen consists of the text describing the account balance, overview, and notifications.
The Budget Screen shows progress in the context of the user’s custom monthly budget plan. The user can set this as anything for various categories. The UI components consist of various graphs such as progress bars and pie charts for each category of configured budget.
The transaction screen can link various accounts such as debit and credit card and keeps track of recent spending from various of these accounts. The UI of this consists of a long list with front and back arrows. Each list item is a transaction with a company, loss or gain of money, and a date.
The goals screen is also customizable, and this displays progress towards the user's set goals, such as saving goals or debt repayment plan tracking. The UI mainly consists of trends over time and some text analysis of your goals over time.
Lastly, the setting screen acts as an index where the user can do things like edit their profile, their contact email, theme of the app, permissions, etc. The UI component of this is simply a list with various screens for various settings.
The two main categories of data sources are user input data and external data. User input data is any personal data that the user has willfully volunteered, such as long-term saving goals, debt payment goals, and things like name, birthday, social security number. 
The other category of data consists of external data. Bank account and credit card account data can be, upon the verification and request of the user, connected to Mint so that these individual databases of spending activity can be updated and analyzed in tandem in real time on the Mint application. This means that Mint must be compatible with various bank API’s. There is no consistency with bank APIs because they are independent for-profit institutions. Mint must have flexible multi-directional compatibility. The other external data source that Mint must maintain compatibility with is the Credit Bureau. Like banks, credit bureaus have their own unique APIs which incorporate their own data analysis scripting to independently verify a user's credit score. 
In summary, Mint is an app where users can view their independent financial data such as credit scores, credit card transactions, debit card transactions, and savings account information, from one GUI. On top of this, Mint has many features which allow users to set and track goals and habits that take into account these financial data sources. This is remarkable, because between a bank account and a credit card, there is no automatic compatibility, and before we had apps like Mint, it was up to each user to track all their accounts separately and diligently. Mint provides a great time saver and a great way to stay accountable for personal finances.
